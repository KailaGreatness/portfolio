			<p>My name is Kaila Greatness Price and I am a UX designer, UX researcher, graphic designer, and fashion lover.
                I currently am studying UX Design and Research at the University of Michigan.
                I will graduate with high distinction and obtain my Master of Science degree in May 2024.
                Design, in particular, UX design and research has become a strong passion of mine because, I have always been fascinated by how people interact with technology and how user experience design can influence these interactions. 
                Through my studies and work experiences, I have come to appreciate the importance of creating user-centered designs that are intuitive, functional, and aesthetically pleasing. 
                I believe that UX design is not just about making things look good, but also about creative problem solving which creates solutions that meet users' needs and enhance their complete experience. 
                As someone who has always been interested in the intersection of design and technology, I was drawn to the field of information science (in particular, user experience (UX) design and research) because, it allows me to use my creativity and technical skills to solve real-world problems and improve people's lives.
